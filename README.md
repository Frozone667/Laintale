This game is a 2D adventure game that combines exploration and turn-based combat.
The player moves freely around an overworld, explores the environment, and encounters enemies by interacting with special trigger areas.

When an enemy is engaged, the game switches to a battle mode inspired by Undertale. The player controls a heart-shaped soul inside a battle box and must dodge incoming attacks in real time. After surviving the enemy’s attack phase, the player gets a turn to attack, dealing damage to the enemy.

The battle becomes more difficult as it progresses, with faster and more frequent attacks. The game features smooth transitions, animated characters, dynamic music, and visual feedback such as damage animations and invulnerability effects.

The goal of the game is to defeat the enemy, survive the battle phases, and return to the overworld. If the player’s health reaches zero, the game ends.
